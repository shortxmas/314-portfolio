### Effort Estimation and Tracking Essay

Effort estimation and tracking were essential aspects of managing my contributions to our final project. This essay reflects on my approach to estimating effort, the benefits of these estimates and tracking, and the methods I used for tracking time.

#### How Did I Make My Effort Estimates?

I based my effort estimates primarily on past experience with implementing or working on issues of similar scope or difficulty. For instance, if a task involved adding functionality similar to something I had done before, I used the time it took for the earlier task as a reference point. Additionally, I considered the complexity of the issue, the dependencies involved, and the potential challenges I might face while completing the task.

#### Benefits of Effort Estimation

Even though my estimates were not always accurate—and were sometimes far off—I believe there were significant benefits to making these estimates in advance. The process gave me a clearer sense of time management, helping me to allocate enough time to focus on issues without being overwhelmed by deadlines. Effort estimation also encouraged me to reflect on how much time specific tasks might realistically require, even if the actual time differed in execution.

#### Benefits of Tracking Actual Effort

Tracking the actual effort expended on issues proved to be beneficial in multiple ways:

1. **Comparative Analysis:** By comparing the estimated time to the actual time spent, I gained insights into my estimation accuracy and areas for improvement.
2. **Understanding Time Allocation:** Tracking effort helped me understand how much of my time was spent actively coding versus non-coding activities such as planning, debugging, or researching solutions. This awareness was valuable for identifying where efficiency improvements could be made.

#### How Did I Track My Actual Effort?

I used a timer to track my actual effort. The timer started as soon as I created the issue branch and ended when I opened a pull request for review. I believe this method provided a relatively accurate measure of the time I spent on each issue, as it closely aligned with the active period of working on the task.

#### Conclusion

Effort estimation and tracking were invaluable tools during our final project. While my estimates were not always spot-on, the process of estimating helped me manage my time effectively and set expectations. Tracking actual effort provided critical insights into my workflow, helping me identify where I spent my time and how I could improve my approach for future tasks. These practices have made me more mindful of my work habits and better equipped for future projects.
