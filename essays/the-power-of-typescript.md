As someone with extensive experience working with TypeScript, both during internships and in professional settings, I have developed a strong appreciation for the language. In this essay, I will explain my thoughts on TypeScript, comparing it to other programming languages I've used and reflecting on its role in software engineering, particularly within the context of software engineering practices. 

TypeScript has become one of my favorite languages, specifically when it comes to developing web applications. Its static type system is the key feature that makes it different from JavaScript, and for me, this feature makes TypeScript feel like the natural progression for front-end development.

From a software engineering perspective, TypeScript provides the best of both worlds: the flexibility of JavaScript along with the safety of a typed language. In a lot of ways, it reminds me of working with languages like Java or C, where types are explicitly defined, and type-checking happens at compile time. This similarity to traditional languages was comforting for me, as I had experience with both Java and C, and I found the transition to TypeScript to be really easy. The difference is that TypeScript is designed off the dynamic nature of JavaScript which makes it more fit for web development. 

In my opinion, TypeScript should be the industry standard for any client side code. One of the reasons I feel so strongly about this is because TypeScript allows developers to catch errors early. Type-checking provides feedback during development, preventing runtime errors that would otherwise only get caught when code is executed. 

For example, in my internships, I worked on several projects where we really relied on TypeScript. With the type system, we defined interfaces, making it much easier for multiple developers to work on the same codebase without breaking functionality. This type of collaboration is very important in a professional environment, and I can’t picture achieving this with plain JavaScript.

In JavaScript, developers have to spend time manually checking types or writing additional checks to ensure the code works as expected. TypeScript gets rid of this need, as the type system makes sure that variables and functions are used in a predictable way. This not only makes the code easier to read but also helps prevent bugs that can arise from type mismatches. 

In this sense, TypeScript 100% makes software more maintainable in the long term. A well-typed codebase is easier to refactor, which is very important in the always changing world of software development. I have found that even with little to no comments, TypeScript code is most likely self-explanatory because of the explicit type annotations, and this has been a huge help in my own projects. 

During one of my internships, I learned about using async/await in TypeScript/JavaScript, and it changed how I handled asynchronous code. The clear and readable structure of async/await, combined with TypeScript's type system made working with promises a lot more reliable and reduced the chances of errors. After discovering how much better it was compared to the traditional .then(() => {}), I began using async/await everywhere.

So far, I’ve found the WODs to be not too difficult and actually pretty fun. Since TypeScript is typically used for building UI logic and not business logic in real-world code, it was a fun change to apply it to data structures, algorithms, and logic-based problems. The timed exercises are enjoyable and allow me to explore a different side of TypeScript and I appreciate the challenge of using the language in this more algorithmic context.

In conclusion, TypeScript has become an important tool in my software engineering toolkit. Its type system along with its compatibility with JavaScript and modern ES6 features, makes it a very powerful language for writing scalable and maintainable code. TypeScript is a perfect balance between flexibility and structure, making it preferred for both small projects and large enterprise-level applications.
